       Hi I am Stacey and I am the baker at Cookies and Cake. I am a wife and mother to 2 small boys. Balancing family and business can sometimes be a struggle 
       but I love that I can share my passion for sweets with family and friends. I have loved baking since joining my mother in the kitchen as a child. 
       I am self taught and am always looking for ways to improve or opportunities to try something new. I hope to be a part of your next celebration 
       and am available to answer any questions you may have.
